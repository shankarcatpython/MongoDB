It only has 43,000 miles on it and has hundreds of thousands of miles ahead of itself and is a great option for anyone interested in Tacomas or just a sturdy reliable vehicle. I'm selling this as I am investing more of my money into other hobbies and I am also looking to get into an old 4Runner, Landcruiser or Sequoia.  The truck is stock and has had regular maintenance conducted. Weather Tech Mats are installed and included and have made a huge difference in preserving the vehicle. The title is Clean and the truck has not been in any Car Accidents. It does has signs of use like small scratches and dents however they are small and the Cement Gray body color helps reduce their visibility.  Looking for $35,000 or a Trade w/Cash for a late 1990s or early 2000s 4Runner, Landcruiser or Sequoia.   If interested please email me and we can arrange a test drive and/or inspection.
